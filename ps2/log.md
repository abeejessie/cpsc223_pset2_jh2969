# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with: Office Hours

# Discussion
I had to spend a lot of time trying to decide what to do, and I had to review c documentation extensively because I have no prior experience with C. It was difficult but the self study was worth it. A lit of the files were confusing but I was better in VS code than last time. All the workthroughs were definitely helpful and greatly appreciated.
